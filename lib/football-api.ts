// DEPRECATED: This file is dead code.
// All API-Football calls should use lib/api-football.ts (which uses API_FOOTBALL_KEY env var).
// This file previously used FOOTBALL_API_KEY (different env var) with in-memory cache.
// Kept as empty placeholder to avoid import errors — will be fully removed in next cleanup.
